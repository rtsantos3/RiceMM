    "\"The mesophyll and bundle sheath networks are connected by a range of cytosolic transport metabolites including amino acids, sugars (glucose, fructose, sucrose, trehalose, ribose), single phosphorylated sugar (glucose-6-phosphate, glucose-1-phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate, sucrose-6-phosphate), mono-/di-/tri-carboxylic acids (phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate, citrate, cis-aconitate, isocitrate, α-ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, malate), glyceric acids (2-Phosphoglycerate, 3-Phosphoglycerate), glycolate, glycerate, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, di-hydroxyacetone-phosphate and CO2. Nucleotides, NAD/NADH, NADP/NADPH, pyrophosphate, inorganic phosphate are not considered as transport metabolites. Oxaloacetate has been excluded as transport metabolite since concentrations of oxaloacetate are very low in vivo and it is reasonably unstable in aqueous solutions.\""
