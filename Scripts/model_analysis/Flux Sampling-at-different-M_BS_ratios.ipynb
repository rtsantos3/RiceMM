    "Flux sampling is another constraints-based technique used for characterizing the null space of a given stoichiometric model, providing us insights on the flux distributions of a given metabolic model without the explicit definition of a given cellular objective. Not only does this technique offer advantages over conventional FBA and FVA where it allows researchers to determine the feasibility of solutions within a given defined range, as well as the distribution of these fluxes provided the model constaints.. The latter, in turn, allows statistical analysis to determine whether any given fluxes exist within a single probability distribution or not. This, in turn, allows a more direct comparison of fluxes and to adequately sample a solution space provided the constraints implemented in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same constraints have been implemented as with the previous set-ups but with a modification with regards to how the objective functions are concerned. Unlike in pFBA where we can set a particular reaction as an objective, no such setting exists for flux sampling. Thus, this setup is in turn reliant on explicitly defined constraints that would define the n reaction-dimensional solution space. To parametrize this, we have turned off all biomass-related demands such as Coleoptile Biomass, Straw_Biomass and the \"DM_Phloem_M\" reaction to force the model to output flux to the \"DM_Phloem_BS\" reaction. Additionally, the model is constrained in a similar manner as with the previous pFBA setups that we had done to benchmark and assess our model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "THe benefits of using Flux Sampling compared to other methods such as FVA in characterizing a solution space is that:\n",
    "a. We may establish confidence intervals with the use of statistical tests to fully characterize a given solution space and whether\n",
    "b. Rather than simply generating representative fluxes showing the maximum and minimum amount of possible flux towards a particular reaction, flux sampling allows summary statistics to be generated, including the probability distribution of each particular reaction. \n",
    "c. Lastly, flux sampling allows a detailed comparison of the interdependence of each particular reaction, showing which reactions are coupled to each other in a positive and negative fashion. This is done\n",
    "\n",
    "Three setups per parametrized model were initialized, each with a representative light treatment of 250, 750 and 1500 PPFD with a defined range of +-25, respectively. The NGAM reactions were instead set at a static value at each representative light point detailed above. A total of 6 treatments were initialized to represent both the WT and Trans models at the selected light points. \n",
    "\n",
    "The sampling algorithm used was the OPTGP (optimized general parallel) sampler from the Cobrapy.sampling package. The sampler was parametrized to generate 5000 samples with a thinning coefficient of 25000, representing 1.25x10^8 sampling points, and was multithreaded into 7 processes each. Run times varied from between 3-6 hours per model parametrized, which was expected based on the number of reactions in the parametrized model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After the generation of individual sampling points, convergence statistics were done to assess the level of autocorrelation as well as to assess whether the samplers have sufficiently converged to a singular value. The former is done with the use of the \"acf\" function to assess the level of autocorrelation on each given column, while the latter is assessed with the use of two specific methods -- the Gelman-Rubin and the Geweke statistics. These are two methods that we will use to assess whether the number of sampling points is sufficient to ensure adequate convergence of each reaction in the model. Reactions that have not converged sufficiently will be indicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the assessment of autocorrelation and convergence, each of the pairs between light treatments (225-725, 725-1475, 225-1475) and between models (WT and Trans) are subjected to pairwise Kruskal-Wallis tests to assess which reaction pairs are derived from the same distribution. It is a non-parametric rank-based test test suitable for comparing outputs where there are no assumed distributions behind a population, and has been used in a similar fashion in previous flux sampling setups that involve Plant Metabolism  (Herrmann et al., 2019).  \n",
    "\n",
    "This procedure, in turn, allows us to deduce in finer detail which reactions in particular are positively correlated with CO2 flux into the BS cell's Rubisco reaction. In the previous pFBA experiment we were able to demonstrate a similar approach to this by performing a sensitivity analysis on Glycine Decarboxylase, and had demonstrated the negative relationship between M cell GLYDHD and BS Cell GLYDHD.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we can afterwards assess which fluxes are coupled by iterating over the list of fluxes in a single flux sample matrix and computing the spearman correlations between the pairwise comparisons. From here we can assess which particular reactions are positively or negatively correlated or not. A particular focus will then be held. Further Downstream analysis includes determination of reactions that are positively or negatively coupled with each other and corroborating this fact on whether the reaction is disrupted in the \"Trans\" parametrized model.  \n",

    "I've encountered some numerical issues that had been fixed simply by increasinng the model tolerance to 1e-9. I think also putting my model as a contextual instance also helped -- I suspect some form of \"Batch contamination\" being carried over from previous iterations causing the model to be unsolvable once it encounters an infeasible solution.\n",
