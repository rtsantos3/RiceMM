    "- Small amounts of flux toward malate is detected and is exported to the BS cell and is subsequently transported mainly to the stroma and peroxisome via the Malate-Glutamate antiporter (Stromal) and the Malate-Oxaloacetate antiporter (Peroxisomal), respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Stroma, it is then exported out via the AKG-Malate antiporter back into the cytosol while AKG is used for glutamate synthesis rather than towards CO2 fixation. This implies that a malate shuttle is functioning in a c3 system with a locally-expressed NADP-ME C4 enzyme. However, this cycle is truncated and the malate being shuttled is preferentially used for Glutamate synthesis instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, CO2 availability is augmented in the BS stroma with the release of CO2 from anaplerotic reactions such as Pyruvate Dehydrogenase, Diaminoopimelate decarboxylase and others also related with Amino acid biosynthesis. Such a phenomenon is not observed in the stromal compartment of the M cell and instead is mostly supplied by atmospheric CO2 absorption and Mitochondrial CO2 production.\n",
    "\n",
    "ASPARTATE EXPORT FROM THE M CELL\n",
    "\n",
    "Another alternative pathway to C4 photosynthesis found in C3-C4 intermediate species is the Aspartate shuttle. In this case, Aspartate export from the M cell is observed in the model parametrized with the Trans reactions at light levels around 500 ppfd above. Most of the Aspartate (~50 percent) is exported to the Chloroplast via the H-Asp symporter (Stromal) while the rest is either exported as a photoassimilate (via the Phloem demand reaction) and  piped towards reactions specific for AA biosynthesis either in the cytosol or stroma. In the stroma, in particular, the majority of the transported Aspartate is relegated to the Phosphorylated pathway of Serine Biosynthesis (PPSB), w/c produces threonine and cysteine.\n",

    "In both cases, Pyr export into the BS Cell was observed in both WT and Trans-parametrized models, with the latter having a higher export rate than the Trans model. However, it was observed that most of the exported Pyruvate is used as a nitrogen acceptor for the generation of Alanine.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these, it is then observed that the fluxes of ketoacids and carbon intermediates is relegated mostly towards Amino acid biosynthesis, which is consistent with the findings of Hua et al 2021 where Bundle Sheath cells in rice were found to be preconditioned towards both solute transport (for phloem loading), water transport and Amino acid Biosynthesis. This inference was made by checking the enrichment patterns of the transcriptomes found in each of the excised tissue fractions corresponding to the BS and M cells.\n",

    "It was observed under high light that flux of Malate through the PD is observed at a minimal flux level (~0.31 umol/m2s). However, this does not occur in all solutions generated by the Trans model and may only occur in certain flux distributions. This may be further detected using Flux Sampling to see the probability distribution of the flux values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, the fate of Malate in the BS cell is observed to be shunted towards the Stroma, where it is converted into AKG and subsequently used for Glutamate biosynthesis (Glutamate synthase  in Stroma). IN the Peroxisome, roughly a third of the transported malate is converted  to Oxaloacetate, which is then utilized in a sort of futile cycling that shuttles Malate and Oxaloacetate back to the cytosol without any end products. However, it is apparent that it may be a mechanism to maintain NAD/NADH balance within the Peroxisome, which in turn is utilized in the partial C2 cycle to oxidize H-pyruvate to R-glycerate within the compartment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This cycle is found to be more apparent in the Trans-parametrized model than in the WT model where almost 40 percent of the malate in the BS cell is shuttled towards the peroxisome.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in the Line 29 used to parametrize  the Transgenic model, the NADP-ME decarboxylating enzyme is ectopically expressed in the M mitochondria, which prevents Malate from being used in the Calvin Cycle in the BS cell. This is consistent with the results by Ermakova et al (2021) wherein the expression of NADP-ME was the least consistent of all the enzymes that were inserted to rice and that no decarboxylation was observed in vivo. However, observing the flux distributions within the M mitochondrial cell reveal the utilization of both transgenic MDHs (NADP and NAD). \n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, there is a shift in the utilization of either MDHs based on light conditions, wherein the NAD-utilizing MDH is predominant at lower light levels while the NADP-utilizing MDH (which produces CO2) is inactive at low light while active at high light levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "For recommendation: Deactivating flux towards the OAA-Mal shuttle may allow more Malate to be shuttled to the Stroma instead of being cycled towards the peroxisome. I need to check whether this is active in the BS cell using the transcriptomic data from Hua et al (2021). Interestingly enough it doesn't have any annotated GPRs but I may try to find it by finding a reference for it. \n",
