    "Weirdly enough the Shameer model is even much more imbalanced compared dun sa current model ko, which I believe is more of an encoding issue as opposed with actual mass-charge violations, considering that there weren't much changes done by the author in their supplementary scripts. \n",
    "Meanwhile, the core Arabidopsis model used by B&B doesn't have much mass-charge violations owing to the small size of the model.\n",
    "So far after implementing constraints on cofactor recycling (based on the Boolean logic algorithm formulated by Lakshmanan in the original iOS2164) there seems to be limited evidence of any type II or type III internal loops with pFBA. Furthermore, there is concordance with the scale of flux values when comparing with the experimentation by Shameer et al in both the purely linear diel model and the hybrid kinetic setup (2018 and 2019), indicating that the model produces relatively realistic ATP rates and other things.
