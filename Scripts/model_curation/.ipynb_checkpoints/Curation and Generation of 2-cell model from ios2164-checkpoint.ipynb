    "Nucleotides, NAD/NADH, NADP/NADPH, pyrophosphate, inorganic phosphate are not considered as transport metabolites. \n",
    "\n",
    "Oxaloacetate has been excluded as transport metabolite since concentrations of oxaloacetate are very low in vivo and it is reasonably unstable in aqueous solutions. \n",

    "Other small molecules that can be imported by the bundle sheath from the environment, as well as protons and HCO3-, are not exchanged between the two cell types.\n",
