    "\n",
    "Findings:\n",
    "- Glycine Decarboxylase is modulated in the trans-parametrized models without explicit constraints, showing a lower reaction flux in the M comnpartment compared to the BS comparement.\n",
    "- Reaction becomes decoupled only at high light while  showing close distributions at low to medium light levels -- although the KW test reports significant differences in the distribution between the two parametizations @ 95% confidence interval. I'll check with 99.99% interval instead\n",
    "    - It is coupled in low and medium lights and only diverges @ high light treatments. \n",
    "- The most likely culprit for the decrease in Gly DC activity in M cells is the increase in flux of NH4 to BS cell Mit. However, it does not correspond with an increase in GLyDH activity in the BS cell meaning that it is being used up in other reactions. Other reactions that were found to increase is the import of Serine into the M cell which is @ equilibrium but slightly skewed towards BS cell export in the Trans model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: \n",
    "- Is dihydrolipoylprotein:NAD+ oxidoreductase skewed towards NAD+ reduction or Oxidation? -- (It is towards regeneration of NADH) in both WT and TR.\n",
    "- Therefore, is the reduction in glycine flux attributable to other reactions that reduce the NADH pool? Let's check all the reactions that make use of NADH in the M compartment.\n",
    "- Based on the below plots, only Malate Dehydrogenase has a significantly varying distribution compared to the other reactions that involve NADH. The Trans model shows significantly lowered flux toward the oxidation of Malate and in turn the regeneration of NADH. The other reaction is the NADORm_M reaction, which corresponds to the NADH-coenzyme Q oxidoreductase reaction that consumes NADH to produce ubiquinol.\n",
    "\n",
    "- These are the most likely culprits behind the reduced flux towards the GlyDC reaction as reduction of flux towards  Malate Dehydrogenase reaction reduces the Mitochondria. The **NADOR** reaction also consumes NADH to reduce Ubiquinone and has quite a high flux towards consumption of NADH.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another question:\n",
    "- Why is demand for q8h2 so high in the trans model? Let's check the reactions involving this metabolite.\n",
    "    - Results show that the reaction CYOR (Cytochrome Oxidoreductase) has a significantly higher flux in TR than in WT. What does it mean?\n",
    "    - I haven't modified this reaction so it has a significantly high imbalance (which I think is similar to other models)\n",
    "    - Both Coenzyme Q and Cytochrome Oxidoreductase are significantly higher in high light conditions. How about in low and medium light conditions?\n",
    "    \n",
    "        - Only in high light conditions is this true. Meaning that the cytochrome fluxes are significantly higher in the Trans parametrized model for some reason, not sure why.\n",
    "        I need to review literature on this, particularly this:\n",
    "            \"Mitochondria in photosynthetic cells: Coordinating redox control and energy balance\" \n",
    "        Since the involved reactions are part of the ETC.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        I think this is also related towards the mitochondrial production of Citrate via CSm since it is also significantly upregulated in the Trans compared to the WT. This I think shows evidence of a significantly higher percent of photoassimilates being diverted to the Citric Acid Cycle. However, is it for the purpose of exporting citrate to the cytosol?\n",
    "            - It is and it is equal to the amount of flux towards the Citrate Synthase, meaning that the flux towards the TCA cycle is hemicyclic and is for generating Redox potential in the Cytosol (Igamberdiev & Bykova, 2023). This may indicate a deficit in redox units in the Cytosol which necessitate its synthesis and export.\n",
    "            - Increase in Malate dehydrogenase carrying capacity in Trans model may be observed to cause this change, which also drives the efflux of Citrate  and the importation of Malate.\n",
